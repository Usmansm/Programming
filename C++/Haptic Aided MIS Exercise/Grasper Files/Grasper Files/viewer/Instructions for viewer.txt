Replace the files SofaViewer.h and SofaViewer.cpp in 

SOFAFolder/applications/sofa/gui/qt/viewer/  (Make a backup of original files somewhere)

and QtViewer.h and QtViewer.cpp in

SOFAFolder/applications/sofa/gui/qt/viewer/qt/ (Make a backup of original files somewhere)

Open cpp solution and compile the code.

(Have a close look at the build process. If output window shows that the solution is up-to-date it 
means that the new code has not compiled. In that case, edit the new files by adding a space somewhere
or writing a comment etc.)
