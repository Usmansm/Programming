<span  style="foont-size:13px;">About CSV contact imports. </span><br/> <br/>

There are two rules which we require: <br/>
1.	We will only import friends/contacts if there is a unique identifying data element which is part of the data record.  <br/>
 - The two qualifying elements are an email address or a mobile phone number. Only one is required. <br/> <br/>
2.	Each friend much have both a first and last name along with the unique data element. <br/> 
 - After you create your CSV file please open it to see if there are corrections which should be made to your data before
you import it into Myiceberg. <br/> <br/>
