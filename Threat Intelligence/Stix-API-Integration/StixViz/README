StixViz v1.0 alpha1
Compatible with STIX v1.0.1

This is an application to visualize a set of STIX documents as a node-link tree 
with the root at the top of the XML structure.

StixViz is implemented in Javascript as a standalone application using the node-webkit
application runtime which is based on the Chromium rendering engine and node.js.

To use STIXViz, first select a set of related XML files using the
'Choose Files' menu.  STIXViz displays a tree containing nodes for top
level STIX entities:  campaign, course of action, exploit target,
incident, indicator, observable, threat actor, and TTP. When the tree
first displays, there is a top level node shown for each component type
included in the xml files processed.  Nodes with a black and white
border can be expanded with a single click.

A down arrow on a link indicates that the child node is specified as
part of the parent node's XML.  For instance, a campaign will contain
links with down arrows to indicator nodes specified by
campaign:Related_Indicators.

An up arrow indicates that the parent node is specified via an idRef
attribute in the child node.   For instance, a threat actor will contain
links to it from incident nodes that specify it under
incident:Threat_Actors.

Long node names are truncated in the tree view.  Mousing over a named
node will display the node's id if it has one, as well as the full
version of the text used as it's name.

A double click on a node will cause it to become the root node of the
tree, hiding other branches from view.   Double click on the root node
again to walk back up the tree.

The 'Show HTML' menu at the top of the page can be used to display an
XSLT transformed file at the bottom of the STIXViz window. Nodes that
have an id specified in the XML file can be displayed in the HTML view
as well.   To do this, click right on the node and select 'Show HTML'.

Each category of top level "items" is turned into a node in the tree. 
The nodes themselves are expandable to show the structure of the relationships 
between entities. 

This is a work in progress.  Feedback is most welcome!

--Usage Notes-------------------------------------------------------------------

Building: 
The StixViz app depends on the node.js "mime" module which is available from the npm package management system.
The mime module is already included in the node_modules directory of this package. To 
reinstall the mime module, be sure you have node.js installed, then cd to the root directory of the StixViz app 
and execute the command: 
> npm install mime

To run the StixViz app using node-webkit, execute the following command: 

> nw.exe {path to StixViz main directory}

To package the StixViz app to run standalone perform the following steps on Windows: 

1. Create a zip file (NOT zipx) containing index.html, package.json, the public directory and the node_modules directory
2. Name the zip file StixViz.nw
3. At the command prompt run 
> copy /b nw.exe+StixViz.nw StixViz.exe
This will create an executable StixViz.exe 
4. The executable requires the following files that come with the node-webkit distribution to be on the path:
nw.pak 
icudt.dll
ffmpegsumo.dll
libEGL.dll
libGLESv2.dll

On other platforms follow the instructions from https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps
